# Project8X Website Development Plan

## Design Principles (Always Follow)

### Design Rules:
- **Functional and practical**: Prioritize utility and ease of use in all design decisions
- **Use trending features and styles**: Incorporate modern and popular design elements and aesthetics

## Development Process (Always Follow)

### Planning Phase:
1. Create a detailed plan before starting and save it in `plan.md`
2. Create and update a Product Requirements Document (`prd.md`) as we progress
3. Create database schemas and data structures if relevant
4. Review plan and make updates

### Development Phase:
5. Create test cases before starting a development phase
6. Run test cases and resolve issues after development phase
7. Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them in a To-do list
8. If there are open questions that require user input, add them to the plan

### Quality Assurance:
- If not 90% sure on how to proceed, ask clarifying questions
- Always follow the established design principles
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
